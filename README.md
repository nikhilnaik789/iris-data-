kNN From Scratch
🔗 Introduction
This repository consists of code and example implementations for my medium article on building k-Nearest Neighbors from scratch and evaluating it using k-Fold Cross validation which is also built from scratch

For PyPI package version please refer to this repository

k-Nearest Neighbors
k-Nearest Neighbors, kNN for short, is a very simple but powerful technique used for making predictions. The principle behind kNN is to use “most similar historical examples to the new data.”

k-Nearest Neighbors in 4 easy steps
Choose a value for k
Find the distance of the new point to each record of training data
Get the k-Nearest Neighbors
Making Predictions
k-Fold Cross Validation
This technique involves randomly dividing the dataset into k-groups or folds of approximately equal size. The first fold is kept for testing and the model is trained on remaining k-1 folds.
